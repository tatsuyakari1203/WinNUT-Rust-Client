feat: finalize WinNUT Rust Client with automation and notifications

Phase 4 & Refinement Completion:
- Implement conditional system stop (Shutdown, Hibernate, Sleep) with user-defined thresholds.
- Add high-urgency countdown overlay for imminent system actions.
- Implement Event Log system to track UPS status transitions with timestamps.
- Integrate Windows System Notifications for real-time status alerts.
- Rebrand application to "WinNUT Rust Client" for a professional native feel.
- Add "Automation" info & live countdown to the System Information sidebar.
- Complete linting pass: resolved all clippy warnings (uninlined args, borrows) and TSC type checks.
- Clean up unused imports, components, and dead code across the project.
- Fixed critical data-flow bug by restoring useUpsData hook.
